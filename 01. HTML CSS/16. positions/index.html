        Every block-level element appears on a new line, causing each item to appear lower down the page than the
        previous one. Even if you specify the width
        of the boxes and there is space for two elements to sit side-by- side, they will not appear next to each other.
        This is the default behavior (unless you tell the browser to do something else)
